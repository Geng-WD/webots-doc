Today we're happy to announce the release of the all-new Webots 2018b, packed with some great new features.
As always, for a comprehensive list of changes please refer to the ChangeLog, found [here](https://www.cyberbotics.com/dvd/common/doc/webots/ChangeLog.html).

## WREN: Webots Renderer

## New Look and Feel

## Simulation Reset

## New PROTOs

## Extra Goodies

Movies can now be recorded in slow motion.

To ensure reproducible simulations, floating-point precision when saving files has been maximised.

Large MF fields are no longer saved vertically, to reduce file sizes and improve loading times.

The `street_furniture` folder has been filled with more models!
