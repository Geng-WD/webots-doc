## Prerequisites

In this section, you will learn how to setup your Webots environment. It is
obviously a necessary step to get started with the tutorials.

### Install Webots

Webots has to be installed on your computer.

### Create a directory for all your Webots files

The first step is to create a directory which will contain all your files
related to Webots.

### Start Webots

You need to learn how to launch Webots.

Now a simulation is running.

### Create a new Project

The freshly created "my_webots_projects" directory will contain all your Webots
projects. Your first Webots project will be the tutorials of this chapter. So
let's create now a project named "tutorials" which will contain all the
simulations of this chapter.

### The Webots Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The Webots main window is shown in . Make sure you understand well how the
Webots main window is divided into subwindows before continuing. A more detailed
description of the Webots GUI is provided in .

    The Webots main window splits into four dockable subwindows:

    the 3D view in the center,
    the text editor on the right hand side,
    and the console at bottom of the window.
    Note that some of these subwindows have a toolbar with buttons.
    The main menus appear on the top of the main window.
    The virtual time counter and the speedometer are displayed in the right part of the 3D view toolbar.
    The status text is displayed in the bottom left of the main window.
