## Sensors

Webots can simulate a lot of standard robotics sensors.
Using the nodes described [below](#generic-sensor-list) and their corresponding API is sufficient in most of the cases.

More specific sensors are built over these generic nodes, thanks to the [PROTO system](../reference/proto.md).
These sensors are listed by category [in the section below](#branded-sensors).

### Generic Sensor List

| Icon | Device | Description |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| ![Accelerometer.png](images/sensors/Accelerometer.png) | [Accelerometer](../reference/accelerometer.md) | *It simulates an accelerometer sensor which measures the relative accelerations.* |
| ![Camera.png](images/sensors/Camera.png) | [Camera](../reference/camera.md) | *It simulates an RGB camera, a linear camera, a gray-scale camera, a fish-eye camera and a smart camera with multiple special effects including noise, focus, motion blur or lense flares.* |
| ![Compass.png](images/sensors/Compass.png) | [Compass](../reference/compass.md) | *It simulates a magnetic sensor which measures the relative direction to the north.* |
| ![DistanceSensor.png](images/sensors/DistanceSensor.png) | [DistanceSensor](../reference/distancesensor.md) | *It simulates any sensor measuring a distance including an infra-red sensor, a sonar sensor, or a laser range-finder.* |
| ![GPS.png](images/sensors/GPS.png) | [GPS](../reference/gps.md) | *It simulates a positioning sensor which measures the absolute position in Webots coordinate system or in the WGS84 coordinate system.* |
| ![Gyro.png](images/sensors/Gyro.png) | [Gyro](../reference/gyro.md) | *It simulates a gyroscope sensor which measures the relative angular velocities.* |
| ![InertialUnit.png](images/sensors/InertialUnit.png) | [InertialUnit](../reference/inertialunit.md) | *It simulates a sensor which measures the relative roll, pitch and yaw angles.* |
| ![Lidar.png](images/sensors/Lidar.png) | [Lidar](../reference/lidar.md) | *It simulates a laser-scanner sensor also known as lidar.* |
| ![PositionSensor.png](images/sensors/PositionSensor.png) | [PositionSensor](../reference/positionsensor.md) | *It simulates a sensor which can monitor a joint position, including an encoder sensor.* |
| ![Radar.png](images/sensors/Radar.png) | [Radar](../reference/radar.md) | *It simulates a radar sensor.* |
| ![RangeFinder.png](images/sensors/RangeFinder.png) | [RangeFinder](../reference/rangefinder.md) | *It simulates a depth camera also known as range-finder.* |
| ![Receiver.png](images/sensors/Receiver.png) | [Receiver](../reference/receiver.md) | *It simulates radio, serial or infra-red receiver in order to receive data from other robots.* |
| ![TouchSensor.png](images/sensors/TouchSensor.png) | [TouchSensor](../reference/touchsensor.md) | *It simulates a bumper or a force sensor.* |
