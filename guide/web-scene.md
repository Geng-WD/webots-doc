## X3D and Web Scene

### Purpose

Webots can export an entire simulation to a standard [X3D](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) file.
X3D is an XML-based file format for representing 3D computer graphics.
The exported X3D file is containing only graphical information,
and can be open in many 3D modeling softwares.

Additionally to the X3D file, an HTML page is generated.
When open in a web browser, this page shows the X3D scene in a navigable canvas
as shown in ![the figure bellow](#screenshot-of-a-scene-page-generated-by-webots).

%figure "Screenshot of a scene page generated by Webots."
