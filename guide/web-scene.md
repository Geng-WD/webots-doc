## X3D and Web Scene

### Description

Webots can export a world to an interactive 3D `HTML` page.
This feature is especially useful for publishing Webots-created worlds on the Web.

When doing so, an [X3D](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) file and a `HTML5` page are generated.

The [X3D](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) file is containing the graphical information of the world.
`X3D` is a modern `XML`-based file format for representing 3D computer graphics.
It can be imported in many 3D softwares (for visualizing, modeling, etc.).

The `HTML5` page is containing a Webots player which displays the `X3D` file
as shown in [the figure bellow](#screenshot-of-a-web-scene-page-generated-by-webots).
It can be open in any recent Web browser as documented in [the section bellow](#remarks-on-the-used-technologies-and-their-limitations).
The navigation in the player is done using the mouse or the touch screen, similarly than the Webots navigation.

### How to export a Web Scene

Select the `File / Export HTML5 Model...` menu item and choose the target `HTML` file.
Webots is asking to playback the resulting file in the default browser.

**Note**:
The `X3D` file and the required textures are exported in the same directory as the target `HTML` file.

**Note**:
The playback option may not work correctly depending on your default Web browser
(cf. [section bellow](#remarks-on-the-used-technologies-and-their-limitations))


### How to embed a Web Scene in your Website

The exported `HTML` page is designed to be as simple as possible, and is the reference for
an integration in an external Website.
Alternatively, an `<iframe>` tag pointing on the generated Webots page is a less elegant but simpler solution.

The resources (`CSS`, `JavaScript`, etc.) on the [Cyberbotics Website](https://www.cyberbotics.com)
will be stored for long term, and can be used in an external Website.


### Limitations

All the graphical nodes (geometries, appearances, lights, transforms, etc.) are supported.

The rendering of the Webots player is done using the [X3DOM](http://www.x3dom.org) Web standard.
It may occur that the rendering is not strictly equivalent, mainly in term of shadows, lighting, and material rendering.
Our both implementations of the `X3D` standard may differ.


### Remarks on the used Technologies and their Limitations

The Webots player is using internally the `X3DOM` Web standard (based on `WebGL`).

`X3DOM` is supported in recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Internet Explorer and Safari on
Mac OS X (see details on the [X3DOM website](http://www.x3dom.org)).

**Note**:
The Chrome browser cannot open local files using the file protocol by default,
while this is required by the Webots player to open the `X3D` file and the textures.
To work around this, you can either run a local HTTP server in the directory
containing the exported files (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) or
disabling the related Chrome security flag (i.e. by launching Chrome with the
`--allow-file-access-from-files` option).
