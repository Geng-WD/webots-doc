## X3D and Web Scene

<!--
This
is especially useful for publishing Webots-created worlds on the Web. X3DOM is
supported in recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari on
Mac OS X (see details on the [X3DOM website](http://www.x3dom.org)).

> **Note**:
With the Chrome browser, in order to be able to open HTML/X3DOM files locally,
e.g., not from the Web, you may need to allow Chrome to open local files
referred to by the HTML/X3DOM file, e.g., textures. This can be achieved by
passing the `--allow-file-access-from-files` option at Chrome startup. Otherwise
textures won't show up in the 3D models.
-->

### Purpose

Webots can export an entire simulation to a standard [X3D](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) file.
X3D is an XML-based file format for representing 3D computer graphics.
The exported X3D file is containing only graphical information,
and can be open in many 3D modeling softwares.

Additionally to the X3D file, an HTML page is generated.
When open in a web browser, this page shows the X3D scene in a navigable canvas
as shown in ![the figure bellow](#screenshot-of-a-scene-page-generated-by-webots).

%figure "Screenshot of a scene page generated by Webots."
