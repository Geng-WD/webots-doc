## X3D and Web Scene

### Purpose

Webots can export an world to an interactive 3D HTML page.
This feature is especially useful for publishing Webots-created worlds on the Web.

When doing so, an [X3D](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) file and a `HTML5` page are generated.

The [X3D](http://www.web3d.org/x3d/what-x3d) file is containing the graphical information of the world.
`X3D` is a modern XML-based file format for representing 3D computer graphics.
It can be imported in many 3D softwares (for visualizing, modeling, etc.).

The `HTML5` page is containing a Webots player which displays the `X3D` file
as shown in ![the figure bellow](#screenshot-of-a-web-scene-page-generated-by-webots).
It can be open in any recent Web browser as documented in [the section bellow](#remarks-on-the-used-technologies-and-their-limitations).
The navigation in the scene can be done using the mouse or the touch screen, similarly to the Webots navigation.

### Remarks on the used Technologies and their Limitations

The Webots player is using internally the `X3DOM` Web standard (based on `WebGL`).

`X3DOM` is supported in recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Internet Explorer and Safari on
Mac OS X (see details on the [X3DOM website](http://www.x3dom.org)).

**Note**:
The Chrome browser cannot open local files using the file protocol by default,
while this is required by the Webots player to open the `X3D` file and the textures.
To work around this, you can either run a local HTTP server in the directory
containing the exported files (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) or
disabling the related Chrome security flag (i.e. by launching Chrome with the
`--allow-file-access-from-files` option).
