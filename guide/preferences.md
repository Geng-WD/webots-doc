the `Webots > Preferences` menu item on Mac, and from the `Tools > Preferences`
menu item on the other operating systems.

The dialog box is separated into tabs. Each of the following subsection
corresponds to one of this tab.

### General

The `General` tab contains misc preferences about the application.

### OpenGL

The `OpenGL` tab contains preferences about setting the 3D rendering abilities.
The initial parameters of these settings may vary from one computer to another
depending on the GPU OpenGL abilities.
