## Web Animation

### Purpose

Similarly to the web scene export, Webots can export a scene and its animation
(such as the moving objects positions).
An HTML page containing a player is generated.
This player allows to visualize the scene and the animation, as an interactive movie
where the viewpoint can be modified.
The [figure bellow](#screenshot-of-a-animation-page-generated-by-webots)
shows an example of an animation page generated by Webots.
