## Web Animation

### Purpose

Webots can record a simulation to an interactive 3D HTML page.
The result looks like a movie in which the viewpoint can be modified.

The result is similar to a movie with playback controls, except that
you can change the viewpoint at any time.

The mechanism is very similar to the [web scene export](web-scene.md),
except that a supplementary `JSON` animation file containing the moving objects positions is exported.

The [figure bellow](#screenshot-of-a-web-animation-page-generated-by-webots)
shows an example of an animation page generated by Webots.
