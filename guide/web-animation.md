## Web Animation

<!--
The result is similar to a movie with playback controls, except that
you can change the viewpoint at any time. Several files are generated: an X3D
file containing the 3D scene, a JSON file containing the animation data and a
HTML5 file displaying the result using X3DOM and jQuery. Once the animation
recording is started, this item is changed to `Stop HTML5 Animation...` and can
be used to stop the animation recording.
-->

### Purpose

Similarly to the web scene export, Webots can export a scene and its animation
(such as the moving objects positions).
An HTML page containing a player is generated.
This player allows to visualize the scene and the animation, as an interactive movie
where the viewpoint can be modified.
The [figure bellow](#screenshot-of-a-animation-page-generated-by-webots)
shows an example of an animation page generated by Webots.
