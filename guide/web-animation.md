## Web Animation

### Description

Webots can record a simulation to an interactive 3D `HTML` page.
The result looks like a movie in which the viewpoint can be modified.

The result is similar to a movie with playback controls, except that
you can change the viewpoint at any time.

The mechanism is similar to the [web scene export](web-scene.md),
except that a supplementary `JSON` animation file containing the moving objects positions is exported.

The [figure bellow](#screenshot-of-a-web-animation-page-generated-by-webots)
shows an example of an animation page generated by Webots.

### How to export a Web Animation

Select the `File / Make HTML5 Animation...` menu item and choose the target `HTML` file.
Webots is asking to playback the resulting file in the default browser.

**Note**:
The `X3D` file, the `JSON` animation file and the required textures are exported in the same directory as the target `HTML` file.

**Note**:
The playback option may not work correctly depending on your default Web browser
(cf. [section bellow](#remarks-on-the-used-technologies-and-their-limitations))


### How to embed a Web Animation in your Website

Please refer to [this similar section](web-scene.md#how-to-embed-a-web-scene-in-your-website).


### Limitations

Webots is exporting only the `Transform.translation`, `Transform.rotation` and `LED.color` fields.
Modifying the other VRML fields, adding/removing nodes are not recorded in the animation file.

Moreover, please refer to [this similar section](web-scene.md#limitations).
