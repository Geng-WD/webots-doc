The [PICAXE microbot system](http://www.picaxe.com/Hardware/Robot-Kits/PICAXE-20X2-Microbot/) allows to create a robot from hardware pieces.
The system can be fully customized by the end user using different input sensors and output devices (in addition to the on-board motor/gearbox, LED and piezo outputs).
This default pack contains the motherboard, two motor/gearboxes, a bumper module, a line follower module, a pen holder and a servo connector.
It can be extended.
