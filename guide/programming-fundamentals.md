# Programming Fundamentals

This chapter introduces the basic concepts of programming with Webots. Webots
controllers can be written in C/C++, Java, Python or *MATLAB*<sup>TM</sup>.
Besides their syntactic differences all these languages share the same low-level
implementation. As long as the sequence of function/method calls does not vary,
every programming language will yield exactly the same simulation results. Hence
the concepts explained here with C examples also apply to
C++/Java/Python/Matlab.
