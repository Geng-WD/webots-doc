## An error occurs when compiling the plugins

If you are working on Linux and you installed Webots from the tarball package, it could be that some libraries are missing on your system.
Usually you should get error messages in the Webots console mentioning the missing dependencies.
Otherwise here are the instructions to install all the required ones:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libssh-dev libzip-dev
```
