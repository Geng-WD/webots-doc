# Robot Window

When you double click on the robot, a new window appears. This window is called
`Robot Window`, it has several tabs allowing you to perform different things.
First tabs concern the simulation. They will be described here, the last tab is
used to interact with the real robot and will therefore be described in next
sections.

You can at any time restart the `Robot Window` by pressing the revert button of
the simulation.
