## Ros support

In order to access all the services corresponding to the functions of the
[driver](driver-library.md#driver-library) and [car](car-library.md#car-library)
libraries, the `ros_automobile` controller should be used.

> **note**:
You will need to copy the automobile service files in your catkin workspace to
be able to use them.
